After the ticket has been submitted, it will be put into the database where people who have access to the tickets can read and assign them to the proper team or individual. After being assigned, they will be given proper assignment to an individual, correct priority level and SLA and responded to.

In this example, "Suhai" assigns the task to Nathan and also changes priority level and also the SLA. He gives a comment on how and who will handle the situation and is then followed up by Nathan. Since Nathan is assigned the ticket, after he has solved the issue, he would resolve the ticket and the ticket would then be closed.
